# SEEL

The LoRa Synchronized Energy-Efficient LPWAN (SEEL) communication protocol is a novel Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) utilizing LoRa-PHY technology. SEEL differs from LoRa-WAN and other existing work due to its implementation of an energy-efficient multi-hop tree topology. SEEL is recommended for low data rate applications that require an extensive area to be covered using battery-powered nodes; an example of this is agricultural data collection which typically requires monitoring of large areas without power distribution infrastructure.

While the SEEL protocol is hardware independent, the current implementation of SEEL is designed for the Arduino platform. The code for SEEL will be released soon.

Check the documentation file (provided in this repository) for more details.
